immintrin_dbg.h is an include file, a wrapper around immintrin.h. It implements most of AVX, AVX2, AVX-512 vector intrinsics to enable source level debug.
Usage: just include immintrin_dbg.h in debug build only.
ICC -O -g -xAVX
GCC -Og -std=c99 -g -lm -Wno-psabi -march=sandybridge
Please note, that GCC will compile using SSE registers only. ICC may still use ZMM0 register to return _m512 type from functions.
If compiled with -O3, it will vectorize the debug library which would make debugging harder.

Known bugs:
ieee754 compatible conversions: to test
